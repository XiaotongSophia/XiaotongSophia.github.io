## Project Overview

Multiparty computation is a cryptographic technology that allows using data without seeing it, a property also called input privacy. It does so by distributing the data randomly among a set of parties such that the individual data does not reveal anything, a process called secret sharing. The shared data is then used in a series of messages to come up with a secret sharing of the desired result, which can then be revealed. MP-SPDZ is a research prototype by CSIRO's Data61 implementing a range of protocols and necessary primitives.

## Project Objectives
MP-SPDZ already features a range of algorithms such as deep learning and decision tree learning. This project aims to expand the capabilities by adding further algorithms in dimensionality reduction, density estimation, regression, and classification.
